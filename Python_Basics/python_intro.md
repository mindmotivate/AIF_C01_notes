# Python Language Overview

Python is considered a high-level programming language. In terms of abstraction, here’s a brief overview:

- **Machine Code**: The lowest-level code that communicates directly with the computer hardware.
- **Assembly Code**: A slight abstraction over machine code, providing a more readable way to write low-level instructions.

As you move higher up the levels of abstraction, programming languages become easier to code in:

- **C++**, **Python**, and **Java** are higher-level languages compared to assembly and machine code. They offer more abstraction and easier syntax.

## Why Python is Beginner-Friendly

- **Syntax**: Python’s syntax is extremely easy to understand for beginners, making it an excellent choice for those new to programming.
- **Readability**: Python code is generally more readable and understandable, which simplifies translation and debugging.
- **Reusability**: Python allows for code reuse by breaking code into different files and modules, promoting modularity.

## Built-In Data Structures

Python comes with built-in data structures such as:

- Lists
- Loops
- Tuples

These features contribute to Python’s concise syntax and make it easier to write code compared to languages like Java or C++.

## Use Cases for Python

Python is versatile and commonly used for various tasks, including:

- **Email Notification Scripts**
- **Uploading Files to Buckets**
- **Modifying and Uploading Files to Databases**

## Commenting Code

- **Purpose of Comments**: Comments are essential for explaining code in plain English.
  - **For Yourself**: To create a journal for future reference, especially if you forget the purpose of your code.
  - **For Others**: To help with code reviews or if someone else needs to understand or modify your code.

Effective commenting improves code maintainability and ease of understanding for both current and future developers.



Data Types

Integer = whole number representation

# Integer (int)
my_integer = 39

Floating point numbers
# Floating point number (float)
my_float = 75.412

String = sequences of character data
# String (str)
my_string = 't2.micro'

Boolean
one of two values. True or False
# Boolean (bool)
is_on = True
