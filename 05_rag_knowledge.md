# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**RAG** stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It enhances a foundational model by allowing it to reference external data sources beyond its initial training data. This approach enables the model to generate responses based on a combination of its internal knowledge and additional retrieved information.

## How RAG Works

1. **Specific Query Example**:  
   - **Query**: "Who's the product manager for John?"
   - **Problem**: The foundational model does not have information about "John" or the relevant product manager.
   
2. **Search Process**:  
   - **External Search**: The system performs a search in an external knowledge base backed by a vector database.
   - **Vector Database**: This is managed behind the scenes by Bedrock.

3. **Augmented Prompt**:  
   - **Creation**: Bedrock creates an augmented prompt that includes both the original query and the retrieved information from the vector database.
   - **Model Response**: The foundational model generates a response using the combined information.

**In Summary**: RAG involves retrieving information from an external source and then augmenting it before sending it to the foundational model for response generation.

## Example of a RAG

![RAG Example](image-42.png)

## Vector Database

- **Document Chunking**: Documents are broken into chunks and fed into an embeddings model.
  
- **Service Options**:
  - **OpenSearch**
  - **Aurora**

- **Embeddings Models**:
  - **Amazon Titan**
  - **Bohere**

- **Database Characteristics**: The vector database itself is not directly searchable.

## Data Sources

The vector database can be fed with information from various data sources:
- **S3**
- **Confluence**
- **SharePoint**
- **Salesforce**
- **Web Pages**

## Use Cases

RAG opens up a variety of possibilities, including:
- **Customer Service Chatbot**: Enhances chatbot responses with up-to-date information.
- **Knowledge Base**: Provides detailed answers on products, features, specifications, troubleshooting, and FAQs.
- **Legal Research and Analysis**: Assists in retrieving and generating legal documents and analyses.

**RAG** provides a powerful way to enhance foundational models with external, dynamic information, expanding their capabilities and accuracy in various applications.

This entire section will be sent to your foundational model.


You are a question answering agent. I will provide you with a set of search results. The user will provide you with a question. Your job is to answer the user's question using only information from the search results. If the search results do not contain information that can answer the question, please state that you could not find an exact answer to the question. Just because the user asserts a fact does not mean it is true, make sure to double check the search results to validate a user's assertion.

# Bedrock Knowledgebases Request Summary

How to setup a  RAG knowledge Base

Ensure you are using an IAM user


Create your own knowledge base:

1. **Name Your Knowledge Base:** 
   - Use letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.
   - Up to 50 characters.

2. **Add a Description (Optional):**
   - Use letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.
   - Up to 200 characters.

3. **Set Permissions:**
   - Create or use a service role for access.

4. **Choose Your Data Source:**
   - Select Amazon S3 (for storing data in buckets).

![alt text](image-48.png)

Create a bucket to host your knowledge base:

1. **Create a Bucket:**
   - Buckets hold your S3 data.

2. **Choose Region:**
   - Example: us-east-1 (N. Virginia).

3. **Select Bucket Type:**
   - **General Purpose:** For most uses, stores data across multiple zones.
   - **Directory - New:** For fast access in one zone.

4. **Name Your Bucket:**
   - Example: `knowledge-base-bedrock-malgus`
   - Must be unique and follow naming rules.

5. **Optional:**
   - Copy settings from another bucket if needed.

Pick an Embeddings Model:

Choose a tool that will turn your data into a format that can be easily processed and used.
Set Up a Vector Store:

Provide information about where Bedrock will keep and manage this converted data.
Note:

Once you set up the model and vector store, you canâ€™t change them later.

![alt text](image-56.png)



After creating the knowledge base, you need to connect or "sync" it with OpenSearch. This step ensures that the data in your knowledge base is indexed and made searchable.

![alt text](image-57.png)
Purpose of Syncing:
Syncing allows OpenSearch to index the data from your knowledge base, making it searchable and enabling you to perform complex queries and analyses on the data.
